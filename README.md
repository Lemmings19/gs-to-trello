# gs-to-trello

This repo is an adaptation of a script found [here](http://www.littlebluemonkey.com/blog/online-scrum-tools-part-3-upload-existing-product-backlog-into-trello).

**All credit to [little blue monkey](http://www.littlebluemonkey.com/)**. I simply want to clean up the code and give it somewhere to live.

`script.gs` can be used in a Google Spreadsheet (in the format of [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gCBnYeK3f6uXBAV0jPYfFFFcZEjjeKoJ8Fg2h1PLG90/edit) in particular) to convert cells into Trello cards, card descriptions, card checklists, card assignees, card due dates, labels, etc.

The script includes functionality for discovering (without leaving your Google Spreadsheet) the access codes for what boards, lists, cards, etc. exist within your Trello account.

The 'custom' folder is where I'll be storing custom adaptations of the script.
